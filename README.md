# xss scanner
The script you provided is a Ruby script used for testing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Here are the features and how it can be used:

# Features:

1- Input URLs: The script takes a list of target URLs to scan for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

2- Payloads: It uses a list of XSS payloads that are tested against the URLs to identify potential vulnerabilities.

3- HTTP Requests: The script sends GET requests to the target URLs, modifying them with different payloads to check for XSS vulnerabilities.

4- Response Analysis: It examines the response from the target URLs and checks if the response body contains the injected payload or if the response code is 200 (OK).

5- Vulnerability Detection: If a potential XSS payload is found or if the response code is 200, the script identifies the URL as vulnerable and displays a corresponding message.

6- Output: The script writes the identified vulnerable URLs to an output file.




# Usage and Execution:
****To use this script on Terminal, follow these steps:****
Install Ruby: Ensure that Ruby is installed on your system. You can check if Ruby is installed by running ruby -v in the terminal. If Ruby is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website: https://www.ruby-lang.org/.

Download the Script: Download the script file (CVE-2023-24488.rb) and save it to a directory on your local machine.

Install Required Libraries: Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Run the following commands to install the required libraries:

```
gem update
```
```
gem install httparty
```
```
gem install openssl
```

These commands will download and install the HTTParty and OpenSSL gems.

Run the Script: Once the libraries are installed, you can run the script by executing the following command in the terminal:

```
ruby xss-scanner.rb
```

The script will start running and perform the XSS vulnerability scanning based on the provided URLs and payloads. The output will be displayed in the terminal.

Please note that this script is provided as an example, and running it without proper authorization on websites is illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and legal rights to perform security testing on any target website.
